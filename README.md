# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

This Tic Tac Toe game is implemented in Python, offering players the option to compete against either another human or an AI. There are two distinct AI strategies included: a Random AI, which selects moves unpredictably and without strategy, and a Minimax AI, which employs a decision-making algorithm to optimise its moves.

## Features

- **Two Game Modes**:
  - Player versus Player
  - Player versus AI
- **AI Strategies**:
  - **Random AI**: This AI selects moves at random from the available choices, providing a non-strategic, unpredictable opponent.
  - **Minimax AI**: Utilises the Minimax algorithm, which is a recursive strategy used in decision-making and game theory. This algorithm considers the current state of the board and computes the optimal move by simulating all possible future moves up to the end of the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No additional installation is required apart from Python itself. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), ensuring it is set up on your system if not already installed.

## Usage

To initiate the game, navigate to the directory containing the game script and execute it using Python:

```bash
python3 tic_tac_toe.py
